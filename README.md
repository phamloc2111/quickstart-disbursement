## Overview

Disbursement refers to the act of paying out money, typically from a fund or account. ZaloPay offers disbursement feature that enables merchant transfer money to user. For example, the earned money from a campaign can be rewarded to participants, or company payout the employee's salary, etc . . .

This repository includes examples of integrations for online payments with ZaloPay [Disbursement APIs](https://docs.zalopay.vn/en/v2/payments/disbursement/overview.html). Within this Disbursify demo app, you'll find a simplified version of payroll application, complete with commented code to highlight key features and concepts of Disbursement's APIs.
